# Time-Series-Analysis-on-Stock-Price-Data


**Project Description**

In this project we will analyze and build simple models on historical stock price data using the concepts of Time Series Analysis. We will be working with the historical stock value data of Adani Ports (which has been rising steadily in recent weeks). We will utilize the yfinance api in python to obtain this dataset.
